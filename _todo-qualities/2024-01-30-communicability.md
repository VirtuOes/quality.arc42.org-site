### Definitions:

Communicability in software systems refers to the clarity and effectiveness with which the system conveys its functions and usability to the user. This includes the design of the user interface, the presentation of information, and the system's ability to guide and assist users in accomplishing their tasks.

#### Accessibility for Color Vision Deficiency
> The system must be able to adjust for users with red-green color blindness to ensure the usability of the medical product.


#### Role-Based Interface Customization
> The system must ensure that only input fields relevant to the user's role are displayed.


#### Zoom Functionality
> The system must allow the user to enlarge or reduce the display area.


#### Context-Sensitive Help
> The system must provide context-sensitive help, such as by embedding professional information or guidelines in the context of medication.


#### Data Visibility and Completeness
> The system must ensure that all data are completely and clearly visible, with no data remaining unrecognized in the grid.


#### Consistent UI Design
> The system's user interface must be designed so that buttons, knobs, and colors are arranged in the same systematic way across all dialogs, with the same meaning and function.

#### Consistency in Interface Elements
> The system's user interface must maintain a consistent scheme in the arrangement, meaning, and function of buttons, knobs, and colors in all dialogs to ensure good functionality overview and clarity.


#### Plausibility Checks and Error Messaging
> The system must perform plausibility checks of user inputs. In case of an error, the system must immediately display an understandable error message and allow for quick correction of errors. The customer must be able to set or suppress the type of error messages (info, warning, or stop message).

#### Graduated Warning Presentation
> The system must be capable of presenting warnings in graduated stages to avoid over-alerting.
