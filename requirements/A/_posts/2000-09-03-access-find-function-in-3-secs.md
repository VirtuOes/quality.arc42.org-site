<div class="quality-requirement" markdown="1">

Users must be able to access the _find_ function within 3 seconds of accessing the interface.

**Background**: Users operate the system via a graphical frontend (i.e. like in a typical mobile or desktop application).
One important type of function within the system is _finding_ certain types of date.
